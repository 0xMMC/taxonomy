# taxonomy
This repository contains Excel, JSON and CSV files comprising version 2.0 of the noslegal taxonomy released in May 2023.
There are two Excel files: one with the Places facet of the taxonomy and its extension pages, the second with the other facets of the taxonomy.
The repository also contains release notes in a Word file and a Powerpoint file containing slides on implementation .<br><br>
The taxonomy is intended for categorising legal work and related things (e.g. documents and experience).<br><br>
Use cases include financial reporting, legal operations and knowledge management.<br><br>
We suggest you read the release notes first.<br><br>
Previous releases in 2022 are also available in an archive folder.
