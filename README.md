# taxonomy
This repository contains an Excel file comprising the first release of the noslegal taxonomy together with release notes in a Word file
The taxonomy is intended for categorising legal work and related things (e.g. knowledge artifacts and experience)
Use cases include financial reporting, legal operations and knowledge management - please see the release notes for further detail
The taxonomy has four facets with different levels of maturity (explained in the release notes) -
1) Legal Work 2) Legal Subjects 3) Legal Perspectives 4) Legal Places
We're actively consulting and want public feedback so please contact us with any thoughts, or if you're interested in becoming involved
We plan to actively update this repository with further releases and additional formats.
