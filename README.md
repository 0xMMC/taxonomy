# taxonomy
This repository contains an Excel file comprising the first release of the noslegal taxonomy together with release notes in a Word file.<br><br>
The taxonomy is intended for categorising legal work and related things (e.g. knowledge artifacts and experience).<br><br>
Use cases include financial reporting, legal operations and knowledge management - please see the release notes for further detail.<br><br>
The taxonomy has four facets with different levels of maturity (explained in the release notes) - Legal Work, Subjects, Perspectives and Places.<br><br>
We're actively consulting and want public feedback so please contact us with any thoughts, or if you're interested in becoming involved.<br><br>
We plan to actively update this repository with further releases and additional formats.
