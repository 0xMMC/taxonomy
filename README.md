# taxonomy
This repository contains an Excel file comprising the first release of the noslegal taxonomy together with release notes in a Word file
The taxonomy is intended for categorising legal work and related things (e.g. knowledge artifacts and experience)
Use cases include financial reporting, legal operations and knowledge management - please see the release notes for further detail
The taxonomy has four facets with different levels of maturity (explained in the release notes) -
1) Legal Work
2) Legal Subjects
3) Legal Perspectives
4) Legal Places
Feedback is sought - you can contact us through the noslegal.org website
We plan to actively update this repository with further releases and additional formats.
